# NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitReturnOr - Check for "return $x or ..."

# DESCRIPTION

`return` when encountered in an expression returns from the enclosing
subroutine, without evaluating the rest of the expression. So a
lower-precedence operator (`or`, `and`, `xor`) won't get evaluated
after a `return`. This most commonly appears as the mis-idiom:

    # NO! DON'T DO THIS!
    return $x or die 'Aaaagh! $x was zero!';

Instead, use the higher-precedence `||` operator, like  this:

    return $x || die 'Aaaagh! $x was zero!';

Or separate the two operations, like this:

    $x or die 'Aaaagh! $x was zero!';
    return $x;
